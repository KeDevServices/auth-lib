= Kedev auth lib

Small library that wraps http request and response classes of various frameworks
in order to be able to use the same authentication mechanism everywhere.

It was written for our special requirements, but might serve as inspiration
if you have a similar setup in your project: several (micro)services talking to
each other, implemented using different frameworks (but all on the JVM).
